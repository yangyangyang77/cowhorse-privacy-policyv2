Thank you for using Payday Live / 打工人加油站 (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use our Extension. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to transparency about our data practices.
1. Information We Store
The Extension needs to store certain information locally on your device using the browser's storage capabilities (chrome.storage.sync and chrome.storage.local) to function correctly. This information includes:
Income Data: Monthly salary and annual bonus figures you provide.
Work Schedule: Your selected workdays per week, daily start time, end time, and break duration.
Preferences: Your chosen currency for calculation (Actual Income Currency), your chosen currency for display (Display Currency), and your preferred language (Chinese/English).
Internal Data: The last calculated earned amount is temporarily stored locally (chrome.storage.local) solely to enable the celebration animation upon opening the popup if new income has been generated since the last view.
2. How We Use Your Information
The information stored is used exclusively for the core functionality of the Extension:
To calculate your estimated real-time earnings and daily income target.
To track and display your work progress percentage.
To show the remaining time in your workday.
To apply your currency and language preferences to the display.
To trigger celebratory animations and sounds based on progress or income increase upon opening the popup.
3. Data Storage and Security
Local Storage: All the information listed above is stored locally on your computer within your Chrome browser's storage associated with the Extension. Data stored using chrome.storage.sync may be synchronized across devices if you are signed into your Google Account in Chrome, but this synchronization is handled by Google Chrome and is not accessed or controlled by us. Data stored using chrome.storage.local is specific to the device it was saved on.No Transmission: We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal data on any external servers. Your salary information and settings never leave your local device/browser profile through this Extension.
Security: We rely on the security measures provided by the Google Chrome browser and its storage APIs to protect the locally stored data.
4. Data Sharing
We do not share any of your stored information (salary, work schedule, preferences) with any third parties. Since the data is stored locally and never transmitted to us, we do not have access to it.
5. User Control and Data Deletion
Access and Modification: You can view and modify your stored salary, work schedule, and preferences at any time through the Extension's "Settings" page.
Deletion: You can clear the data stored by the Extension by uninstalling the Extension from your Chrome browser. Uninstalling the Extension will remove the locally stored data associated with it.
6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
